p3
VA person appointed by the provincial or territorial government to perform a range of functions in relation to the youth justice system, including preparation of section 40 pre-sentence reports, supervision of youths on probation, and working with youths after release from custody on community or conditional supervision. In some jurisdictions, youth workers (also called probation officers, or colloquially referred to as POs) have caseloads of only youths; in others, they may work with both adult and youth offenders. In some places, youth workers also do social work with non-offender populations.

VThe court designated by the provincial or territorial government as having jurisdiction over cases prosecuted pursuant to the YCJA. In most jurisdictions the youth justice court is at the provincial or territorial court level. If a youth is charged with murder or is facing an adult sentence, the \u201cyouth justice court\u201d may be presided over by a Superior Court judge, sitting with or without a jury. The YOA used the term \u201cyouth court,\u201d and the term has remained in colloquial use.

VA federal statute that establishes how young people will be treated, tried, and sentenced for criminal offences. The Act applies to suspects who are over twelve but less than eighteen years of age. In certain limited circumstances involving very serious offences, those who are aged fourteen or older may be transferred to adult court. Among other things, the Youth Criminal Justice Act dramatically limits the maximum punishment that might otherwise apply for an offence, and it creates special record-keeping provisions to protect young offenders from the adverse publicity and consequences of having a criminal record.

Among other measures, states must prevent circumvention of encrypted information and the removal of digital tracking measures, although the implementation of these obligations in 1998 by the United States in its Digital Millennium Copyright Act indicates that some decryption and circumvention is legitimate (e.g., for research, police, or individual privacy reasons). Canada's proposed copyright amendments of 2010 (Bill C-32) aim to bring Canadian law in line with this treaty.

C.D., 2005 SCC 78); this approach excluded offences like dangerous driving, where a youth endangered public safety but the intent to cause harm was not proven. The 2012 amendments expanded the concept of violent offence to include offences where the youth endangers the life or safety of another, even if there is no intent to cause harm. The fact that a youth is charged with a violent offence means that the youth may be eligible for pre-trial detention or custody, and even if it is a first offence, there is no presumption of use of extrajudicial sanctions.

VOne of the three standards of review deployed by Canadian courts in reviewing administrative decision-making. This is an intermediate standard employed frequently in appeals from expert administrative tribunals and reflecting a certain level of judicial deference or respect for the decision or action under challenge. It is sometimes referred to as "unreasonableness simpliciter" to distinguish it from the even more deferential standard of "patent unreasonableness."

VA company in which the shareholders are liable for the obligations of the company in some circumstances. Only a few provinces permit the incorporation of unlimited liability companies and the rules in the provinces that do are not the same. Under the Nova Scotia model, the shareholders are only liable to contribute to paying the company\u2019s creditors where the corporation is being wound up and there are insufficient assets to pay off the creditors. Shareholders are not liable for obligations of the company on a day-to-day basis. Under Alberta law, shareholders are liable for any act, liability, or default on an ongoing basis. Some provinces also permit some professionals like lawyers to form professional corporations that do not provide full limited liability. Though the rules vary from one province to the next, in general, shareholders remain liable for their own professional negligence.

VThe law of unjust enrichment, together with contracts and tort, forms the third pillar which describes the law of private obligations.  Unjust enrichment can be divided into autonomous unjust enrichment and restitution for wrongdoing.  In the former, or true unjust enrichment, the action centres on proof of three elements: an enrichment of the defendant, at the expense of the plaintiff, and the lack of a juristic reason to justify the transfer, or, in English law, the presence of an unjust factor concerning the transfer.  It has been said that autonomous unjust enrichment covers every action similar to a mistaken payment of money.  In the latter, the action is restitutionary only in the sense that the defendant is required to give up gains made from perpetrating a wrong on the plaintiff.

VUniversal Copyright Convention [UCC]: Signed in 1952 and revised in 1971, this treaty enabled the United States and other Pan-American countries that had copyright registries and marking requirements to join with Berne countries in an international treaty. Less demanding than Berne, it allowed a marking like "© David Vaver 2000" to satisfy any formalities a state required as a prerequisite of  copyright. Canada adheres to the UCCs 1952 version. The UCC is less important today because most states, including the United States, have since joined Berne, and TRIPS also mandates compliance with Berne's higher obligations and "no-formalities" rules.

Since that time the Convention has been adopted and ratified in over seventy-eight states including the majority of trading nations. The Convention has been adopted and ratified in Canada and the respective Provinces. The Convention applies to all contracts of sale of goods between parties whose places of business are in different states. However, the Convention excludes goods bought for personal, family, or household use. The Convention also provides for individual parties to contract out or vary the functioning of the Convention.

TRIPS requires high minimum standards of IP protection of its members, with trade panels adjudicating disputes and imposing sanctions for non-observance.  Most cases have been brought by the United States and the European Union against countries of the developing world, but Canada too has been targeted, preventing the stockpiling of generic copies of patented medicines for early entry when the drug went off-patent.

In the case of sales taxes, the tax base is the value of items that are subject to tax; basic groceries, for example, are not part of the tax base of the GST. When economists speak of the tax base being broadened, they mean that a wider range of goods, services, and income has been made subject to a tax.

(If there is a King in power, the \u201cR.\u201d stands for Rex); in the foregoing example, Williams would be the accused, the person being tried by the government.

Any other person seeking to influence shareholder voting must also send out a circular in prescribed form subject to certain exceptions.

The appropriateness of a particular sanction is largely determined by the needs of the victims, and the community, as well as the offender. The focus is on the human beings closely affected by the crime\u201d (at 726).

VAn equitable remedy that annuls or avoids a contract. Rescission is a remedy granted to a plaintiff in the case of fraud, innocent misrepresentation, or because of some other action on the defendant's behalf that amounts to undue influence, unconscionability, or makes the bargain questionable on some other equitable grounds. Rescission in equity operates to roll the contract back to the position the parties were in prior to contracting. This is referred to as rescission ab initio, or "from the beginning." It is to be distinguished from rescission de futuro, or "for the future." The latter terminology is unwisely used to describe the position of a plaintiff who is entitled to terminate a contract for breach. As an equitable remedy rescission is subject to a number of discretionary barriers including delay and affirmation. It is also important for the plaintiff to be able to effect restitutio in integrium. That requires both parties to be restored to their pre-contractual positions. The degree of complete restoration will vary depending on the particular underlying cause of action. In the case of fraud a court will be less particular with giving complete restoration, whereas for an innocent misrepresentation, anything less that complete restoration will bar rescission.

For adults, the last name of the accused is used in the style of cause. For young persons, because of the prohibition on publication of identity in section 110 of the YCJA, law reports use the initials of the youth\u2019s name (e.g. R. v. A.B.); the editorial conventions of some law reports call for use of the first initial of the last name, generally followed in brackets by the first and other initials (e.g., R. v. B.(A.)).

Previously, \u201cprivate company\u201d was defined in the Ontario Securities Act as a corporation whose articles provide that the number of shareholders shall not exceed fifty, exclusive of employees and former employees, share transfer is restricted and any invitation to the public to subscribe for its securities is prohibited. Shares of such a corporation could be traded without complying with the requirement to file a prospectus under the Securities Act. This exemption has been replaced by the \u201cprivate issuer\u201d exemption.

VA permanent establishment is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise carries on its business in whole or in part. The concept of permanent establishment applies when a state determines that, under its domestic law, the business profits of a resident of another state may be taxable. Tax treaties generally provide that the business profits of an enterprise of one contracting state derived from activities or sources in the other contracting state are not taxable by the source state unless they are attributable to a permanent establishment therein.

It is sometimes called "letters patent," from the Latin litterae patentes ("open letters"), meaning that the royal seal was placed at the bottom of the document, making the document a public record open for all to see. The Patent Act still defines "patent" as "letters patent for an invention," being one species of the genus of letters patent, which at various times covered franchises, land grants, honours, and company incorporations.

By 22 June 1990 the accord had been ratified by resolutions of the Senate, House of Commons, and eight provincial legislatures. However, because it required the approval of all ten provinces within a three-year period, it failed to become law in Canada.

In general partnerships, all partners are general partners in the sense that they all have unlimited personal liability. Limited partnerships come into existence only upon a filing being made with the appropriate government authority under provincial limited partnership legislation. Limited partners cannot take part in the management of the business of the partnership or allow their name to be used in the firm name without losing their limited liability status.

In some provinces, like Ontario, partners are protected against most liabilities other than liabilities arising out of their own negligence or the negligence of employees and others under their direct supervision. In other provinces, like Alberta, partners in limited liability partnerships benefit from narrower protection. They are not liable for the negligence of other partners or employees except in limited circumstances. In all provinces, the firm\u2019s assets may be used to satisfy claims arising out of actions by the partners See Ontario Partnerships Act ss. 10 and 44.1\u201344.4

VConsent, permission, or clearance (all interchangeable terms) given by a right-holder (the licensor) to someone (the licensee) to exercise a right held by the licensor. The licence can be oral or written. An exclusive licence gives the licensee alone the right of exercise, to the exclusion of even the licensor (this licence usually has to be written). A sole licence is the same, except the licensor can compete with the licensee. A non-exclusive licence allows the licensor to appoint other licensees in the same area to exercise the right.

VLegal materials (typically books) need to be organized on the shelf to allow for the orderly retrieval of information. The Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. has a system for organizing material by topic that is used by major libraries throughout the world. Library of Congress Subject Headings are a controlled vocabulary used to describe the topic of a book. Thus, all books in a law library that relate to human rights law in Ontario will be assigned the subject heading \u201cHuman rights \u2014 Ontario\u201d and searching in an online library catalogue on that specific subject heading will retrieve all books on that subject held by the library. Related to these subject headings are Library of Congress call numbers that are assigned to a book depending on the book\u2019s topic. The \u201cLaw of Canada\u201d is usually assigned the starting letters \u201cKE\u201d followed by a number that relates to the topic (KE 850 would likely be a book on Canadian contract law). Some Canadian law libraries, however, use the \u201cKF\u201d letters to organize their Canadian legal materials (KF is ordinarily the \u201cLaw of America\u201d and when Canadian law libraries use KF for Canadian materials, it is referred to as \u201cKF Modified\u201d).

VA term used loosely to refer to a wide variety of legal arrangements in which one or more parties combine their resources for some limited purpose, for a limited time, or both. It is not a distinct form of business organization, nor a relationship that has any precise legal meaning. A joint venture may be established, for example, by a contract in which the joint venturers agree that they will do certain things to carry out their common purpose; by two people carrying on business together, in which case the joint venture is a partnership; or by two people forming a corporation to carry out their common purpose. While the legal consequences of a joint venture that is a corporation or a partnership are clear, the legal consequences of a joint venture relationship that is not a partnership or a corporation are not.

VGenerally, public international law, or the body of laws governing relations between nation-states. International law deals with the legal responsibility of states in their conduct with each other. International law is also used to govern issues relating to the global environment, the global commons such as international waters and outer space, global communications, and world trade. But international law can also be concerned with the treatment of individuals within state boundaries. Some international treaties, for example, those regarding refugees or war crimes, are binding on the Government of Canada when incorporated into Canada's legal system. Further, international human rights, a relatively new sub-set of international law, outlines the rights of individuals against a government either in the country where they are a citizen or where they reside.

VA community-based sentence of intensive support and supervision may be imposed under section 42(2)(l) of the YCJA. Although not defined under the Act, this order contemplates a higher level of support and supervision than ordinary probation, while allowing the youth to continue to reside with his or her family or elsewhere in the community. The youth might, for example, be required by the provincial director to attend a particular educational or treatment program every day. A youth justice court may make an order for intensive support and supervision only if the provincial director consents. The maximum duration is two years.

VA sentence of intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision may be imposed under section 42(2)(r) of the YCJA for a youth found guilty of one of most serious offences, namely murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault, or a third offence involving causing or attempting to cause serious bodily harm, and if the youth is suffering from a mental or emotional disturbance. A youth receiving this sentence is placed in a facility that has more rehabilitative resources than an ordinary custody facility, which may be a mental health facility. A youth justice court may make an order for intensive rehabilitative custody only if a \u201cplan of treatment and intensive community supervision\u201d has been developed and the provincial director consents. The sentence includes a period of conditional supervision in the community, which is subject to stricter legal controls than for a youth released on community supervision following the custodial portion of an ordinary order of custody and supervision.

A superior court of record is the basic level of superior court found in every province and can trace its origins back to the English courts prior to settlement. In contrast, courts can be statutory courts and must look to their empowering statute to determine jurisdiction. Superior courts of record have an inherent jurisdiction to create new rights and remedies consistent with common law methodology and to fulfill the adage that there is no right without a remedy. Superior courts of record, and most statutory courts, also have an inherent jurisdiction to create processes to govern the practices of how the court handles its affairs. Within the second concept of inherent jurisdiction, courts have, for example, evolved search and asset preservation orders.

VA promise by one person to compensate another person for an obligation incurred or payment made by the second person. Usually, an indemnity is given for obligations or payments imposed on the second person caused by something that the first person did. One partner, for example, may agree to indemnify the other partners for payments that the other partners are forced to make under obligations that the first partner imposes on the partnership in breach of the partnership agreement. Corporate statutes provide that corporations must indemnify officers, directors, and certain other persons for expenses incurred in connection with performing duties for or at the request of the corporation, but only if certain requirements are satisfied (e.g., CBCA, s. 124). Corporations have a discretion to indemnify in a broader range of circumstances.

VA decision of the English Court of Exchequer that established the rules on remoteness of damages ((1854), 9 Exch. 341, 156 E.R. 145). The plaintiff was a miller. His mill had stopped because of a breakage of the mill's crankshaft. The plaintiff had contracted with the defendant, a common carrier, to take his broken crankshaft to a manufacturer to be used as a template to cast a new crankshaft. The defendant had delayed in shipping the crankshaft. As a result the plaintiff had lost profits caused by the delay in having his mill made operational. The defendant argued that the plaintiff\u2019s losses were too remote in that at the time of entering the contract the lost profits could not have been contemplated by the parties. The court held that the damages were too remote. In doing so the court established two rules for the determination of remoteness of damages in contract:

VTaxable (including zero-rated) sales by all sectors are eligible for full rebate of tax paid on associated inputs through the input tax credit mechanism. However, certain sectors are also eligible for rebates of a portion of the GST paid on inputs into exempt sales. These rebates go to qualifying public-sector bodies such as municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals (MUSH), as well as to qualifying public service organizations such as charities and non-profit organizations. GST rebates to these institutions minimize the impact of the GST on the cost of providing exempt public services. Other GST rebates include a rebate to foreign tourists for GST paid on hotel accommodation in Canada and goods taken out of the country, as well as a rebate of a portion of the GST paid on the purchase of a new home (excluding rental properties).

If a corporation consolidates its shares on some basis, shareholders may end up with less than a whole share. For example, if all common shares of a corporation were consolidated on a ten for one basis, a holder of five shares would end up holding just one-half of a share. Fractional shares can also arise on certain kinds of corporate reorganizations, such as amalgamations, where existing shares of each amalgamating corporation are exchanged for shares of the corporation that results from the amalgamation. Under the CBCA, corporations may purchase fractional shares for cancellation so long as certain financial tests are met (s. 34).

VA foreign trust is an entity organized outside Canada which is set up to hold and administer funds or property on behalf of beneficiaries. For example, a Canadian taxpayer may transfer funds or property to a foreign trust for the benefit of his children living abroad. However, such arrangements can also be set up for the purpose of reducing income from property for Canadian tax purposes. The Income Tax Act contains provisions designed to prevent the avoidance of tax in such cases.

VA flow-through share is available to mining and petroleum companies to facilitate financing their exploration and development activities.

Flow-through shares are available to all mining and petroleum companies, but are of greater benefit to non-taxpaying junior exploration companies. These companies are unable to use income tax deductions for exploration and development against their corporate income and are willing to forgo the deduction to new investors.

VA program outside the formal court system established under section 10 of the YCJA to deal with youth who have committed offences. Some extrajudicial sanctions programs operate pre-charge and accept police referrals of youth believed to have committed offences but who are not charged, while other programs are post-charge and accept referrals from the police or Crown of youth who have been charged.The fact that a youth has participated in extrajudicial sanctions may be a factor in sentencing if there are later proceedings for another offence.

VA colourful colloquialism of slightly shady connotation, referring to the practice by which an IP right-holder seeks to extend the duration of protection by adding further IP rights to his initial right. So  nineteenth-century publishers would encourage authors or editors to update or revise publications near the end of the term of copyright; the new edition could then be marketed as \u201cnew and improved\u201d and could depress the sale of the competing but now less attractive out-of-copyright work. The practice still continues: \u201capproved\u201d editions of James Joyce\u2019s works, authorized by Joyce\u2019s heirs, may seem more attractive than \u201cunapproved\u201d reprints. Elsewhere patent holders trawl for aspects of their invention which they further patent (e.g., new dosages of patented drugs), or obtain trade-marks over some feature of the invention so that those copying the no longer patented invention will now be sued for trade-mark infringement or passing-off. Wily rights-holders can thus turn decidedly \u201cdeciduous\u201d finite terms of protection lives into \u201cevergreen\u201d infinite terms, unless thwarted by a wilier CIPO or court.

VA legal bar, from medieval law French, meaning "stop." For example, assignors are estopped from challenging their assignee's title, and licensees are estopped from challenging their licensor's title: the assignor or licensee sued by the assignee or licensor for infringement cannot defend by (is estopped from) showing that the right is invalid. Hence, the terms "assignor estoppel" and "licensee estoppel." Someone may be estopped without intending or knowing it. Thus, if A leads B to assume that a certain state of affairs exists, and it would be unfair to let A have a change of heart in the light of what has since happened, B's assumption is treated as true: that is, A is estopped from denying its validity.

VIn Canada, the legal right guaranteed by section 15 of the Charter. Equality is a highly debated concept, but means, at least, that people are entitled to equal treatment from the state in respect of fundamental goods and services. In Canadian law, "equality" is measured against a guarantee of freedom from discrimination, that is, from being singled out for harmful treatment because of personal characteristics such as sex or race. Equality is also described in terms of a formal guarantee of "similar" treatment, say, in being subject to the same laws as everyone else; and as a further guarantee of "substantive equality" that recognizes that "similar treatment" is not always sufficient to ensure equality. Both meanings have been endorsed in Canadian law.

VA business accounting concept. Income for tax purposes must always be calculated and taxes paid in accordance with the rules set out in the Income Tax Act. However, businesses' methods of calculating their income for financial statement purposes often differ from those used for tax purposes, and thus companies' income for financial statement purposes will often differ from (and appear greater than) the income on which businesses actually have to pay taxes. In order to reconcile these two amounts in their books, businesses use the accounting concept of deferred taxes.

VIf a youth is convicted of an offence that did not involve the youth causing, or attempting to cause, serious bodily harm, a youth court may impose a sentence that places the youth in the community subject to various conditions, with the provision that if any of the conditions are breached the youth may serve the remainder of the sentence as a custody order. In the event of breach or \u201capprehended breach\u201d of a condition, the youth may be placed in custody without a prior court hearing, though subject to later court review. A sentence of \u201cdeferred custody and supervision\u201d under section 42(2)(p) of the YCJA is similar to a \u201cconditional sentence\u201d for adults under the Criminal Code. The conditions may result in a youth being under \u201chouse arrest\u201d in the community, or the conditions may give a youth the freedom to attend school, have employment, obtain counselling, or engage in other activities.

VDe minimis is a shortened form of the Latin legal maxim de minimis non curat lex: the law does not concern itself with the trivial. For example, an act that is technically an infringement can be called de minimis if it is thought to be outside the purpose of the law to catch it; the claim can then be dismissed with costs. This decision involves a value judgment that the complaint should either have been resolved without taking up the time of a court or is a minor irritant that, like the unintentional jostle in a crowded street, the complainant should have borne with equanimity.

VThe most severe sentence that can be imposed by a youth justice court under the YCJA is to place a youth in \u201ccustody,\u201d which requires that the youth reside in a facility. Youth custody facilities must not have any adult offenders confined with youths. Under section 85 of the YCJA, provinces must designate the level of youth custody facilities: \u201copen\u201d or \u201csecure.\u201d The youth justice court judge determines the level of custody, while the provincial director determines the specific facility that a youth will be placed in and may move the youth from one facility to another within the designated level. There is significant variation in the size and nature of custody facilities both between and within jurisdictions. Youth custody facilities range from large institutions to small treatment-oriented group homes.

So long as there is some human purpose motivating the act and the harm is not gratuitous, it is not likely to be found to be cruel, however serious the harm to the animal and however trivial the human purpose.

In some contexts, the term \u201cCrown\u201d refers to the lawyer who represents the Crown in court; this person may also be referred to as the Crown attorney or Crown prosecutor. Occasionally, if the Crown is unwilling to prosecute, cases are prosecuted \u201cprivately,\u201d typically by the victim or a lawyer acting on the victim\u2019s behalf, but this is rare in youth justice court as section 24 of the YCJA requires the consent of the Attorney General to a private prosecution of a young person.

VA conference is a group of persons who meet to provide advice for dealing with a youth in the youth justice system. The concept is flexible, but normally the youth, parents of the youth, community representatives, and the victim are invited to participate. A police officer, a youth justice court judge, or the provincial director may convene a conference. A conference may give advice on appropriate extrajudicial measures, conditions for release from pretrial detention or custody, sentence, or sentence review. The conference concept is intended to allow a more restorative and community-based response to be taken to youth offending.

A youth on \u201cconditional supervision\u201d is subject to stricter legal controls than a youth on \u201ccommunity supervision.\u201d Before the date scheduled for release under conditional supervision, a youth justice court hearing is to be held under section 105 to determine the conditions of release, or decide that the last portion of the sentence is to be served in custody. Subject to later court review, a provincial director may return a youth on conditional supervision to custody if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a youth has breached or is about to breach a condition of release.

VWhen a youth justice court imposes a sentence of \u201ccustody and supervision\u201d under section 42(2)(n) of the YCJA, the first two-thirds of the sentence is the \u201ccustodial portion,\u201d while the last one-third is to be served in the community under a supervision order. The period of supervision is subject to mandatory conditions regarding reporting set out in section 97(1) of the YCJA, and the provincial director may impose other conditions to \u201cpromote reintegration of the youth\u201d into the community or \u201cprotection of the public.\u201d There is an expectation that the youth will have a level of supervision and support from youth workers while living in the community. If there is a \u201cserious\u201d breach of the conditions, the youth may be returned to custody subject to court review under section 103. Before expiry of the custodial portion of a sentence, a provincial director may apply to a youth justice court under section 98 for an order that the youth remain in custody rather than being released under community supervision.

VA method of sentencing sometimes used with Aboriginal offenders (and occasionally with other offenders). Typically, the judge, lawyers, police, offender and parents, victim, and other community members and professionals sit in a circle. Everyone has an opportunity to express their feelings about the offence and offender, and their views about an appropriate sentence. If a consensus emerges about an appropriate sentence, the judge will usually impose this sentence, though the judge is not obliged to do so. A body of jurisprudence deals with the appropriateness of circle sentencing for adults, and section 41 of the YCJA recognizes the judicially convened \u201cconference,\u201d which includes the possibility of circle sentencing.

VA form of extrajudicial measure that involves a police officer or a prosecutor meeting with the youth, and often the parents, to warn the youth against further offending, and perhaps make a voluntary referral for counselling or support from some agency. A record is kept of the caution, as a future charge may be dealt with more formally, but record of a caution cannot be used in youth justice court proceedings. There is no legal distinction between a \u201cwarning\u201c and a \u201ccaution,\u201d but the term \u201cwarning\u201d generally refers to an informal caution, given by the investigating officer at the time of apprehension of a youth.

Different formulations of the test are used as a condition of the directors being permitted to take particular actions. To be permitted to declare dividends, the directors must have reasonable grounds to believe that the realizable value of the corporation\u2019s assets is not less than its liabilities and the stated capital of all classes.

References are to Bill C-32 as it stood at its second reading stage in June 1996. The bill was referred to a parliamentary committee to hold hearings and, at press time, was likely to be presented with a number of amendments for third reading. It is projected to be passed by 1997.

VA draft piece of legislation introduced in the applicable legislature. Most often, it is the ruling party that introduces draft legislation, but members of the opposition can also introduce bills; however opposition bills generally do not pass the requisite three readings needed to become law if they are too controversial. Bills can be public (if they are of general application) or private (if they only affect one organization or entity). A bill must pass all three readings and come into force prior to the proroguing of the legislature to become law.

VAnton Piller order takes its name from a decision of the English Court of Appeal in Anton Piller K.G. v. Manufacturing Processes Ltd., [1976] Ch. 55 (C.A.). The appellant, Anton Piller, was a German manufacturer of motors and electric generators used in the computing industry. The respondent was the appellant's agent in the United Kingdom. As agents the respondents had received confidential information surrounding the appellant's business. The appellants found out that the respondents had been in secret communication with other German companies called Ferrostaal and Lechmotoren with a view to giving those companies detailed plans and drawings of the appellant's products so that they could be copied. The appellants were about to launch a new product and feared that details of it might get into the hands of competitors if the respondents were forewarned that the appellants were aware of the respondents' breaches of confidence. Anton Piller commenced ex parte proceedings seeking an injunction to restrain copyright infringement as well as a court order to permit entry to the respondent's premises to search and remove all confidential information owned by the appellants. The injunction was granted but the order for inspection and removal was refused. The appellants appealed the denial of the latter order. In the Court of Appeal the order was granted. From this initial order has grown the jurisprudence on Anton Piller orders, commonly known as civil search warrants.

In the inquisitorial model of justice used in some European countries, judges play a more active role in investigating the alleged offence and questioning witnesses.

VA youth fourteen years or older may have an adult sentence imposed; this is generally only considered if the offence is one of the most serious offences. If the Crown wishes to have the youth justice court impose an adult sentence, the youth must receive notice before trial and will have the right to a jury trial. An adult sentence can be imposed only after a youth justice court determines under section 72 of the YCJA that a youth sentence would \u201cnot be of sufficient length to hold the young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour.\u201d If the youth justice court determines that an adult-length sentence is appropriate, the youth cannot be placed in an adult facility until reaching the age of eighteen years, and there is a discretion in the court to delay transfer to an adult facility through early adulthood.
